# Training Computational Social Science PhD Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers ('24 IC2S2 Tutorial)

## Logistics 

* Time: 1:30-5 PM (July 17, 2024)
* Venue: Houston: Bodek Lounge

## Objective 

### Short version 

tl;dr: This tutorial will help you learn the hideen transcript of being a professional computational social scientist. 

### Long version 

Social scientists with data science skills are increasingly assuming positions as computational social scientists in academic and non-academic organizations. However, as computational social science (CSS) is still relatively new to the social sciences, CSS can feel like a hidden curriculum for many Ph.D. students. 

To support social science Ph.D. students, we provide an accessible tutorial for CSS training based on our collective working experiences in academic, public, and private sector organizations. We argue that students should supplement their traditional social science training in research design and domain expertise with CSS training, focused on three core areas: 

  * (1) learning data science skills; 
  * (2) building a portfolio that uses data science to answer social science questions; and 
  * (3) connecting with computational social scientists. 
  
We conclude with some practical recommendations for departments and professional associations to better support Ph.D. students.

## Orgnization 

The tutorial consists of three sessions. Each session will begin with a short presentation, followed by moderated discussions and an open Q&A. Depending on the number of participants, there will be small group discussions. The participants will have ample opportunities to engage with the panelists. The presentation slides for these sessions will be shared soon.

## Session 1: Learning Data Science Skills (1:30 - 2:30 PM, 15 mins break)  

- Slides [TBD]

## Session 2: Builindg Computational Social Science Portfolio (2:45 - 3:45 PM, 15 mins break)

- Slides [TBD]

## Session 3: Connecting with Computatioanl Social Scientists (4 - 5 PM)

- Slides [TBD]
