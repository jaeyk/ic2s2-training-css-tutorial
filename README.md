# Training Computational Social Science PhD Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers ('24 IC2S2 Tutorial)

## Logistics 

* Time: 1:30-5 PM (July 17, 2024)
* Venue: Houston: Bodek Lounge (['24 IC2S2 schedule](https://ic2s2-2024.org/schedule))

## Objective 

### Short version 

The goal of this tutorial is to assist graduate students, faculty, and administrators in comprehending the various pathways available for students to enhance their computational social science skills, portfolios, and networks.
 
This tutorial will particularly benefit social science PhD students by providing them with a better understanding of the career opportunities that are available in computational social science. Additionally, faculty and administrators will be able to find new ways to support these endeavors.

### Long version 

Social scientists with data science skills are increasingly assuming positions as computational social scientists in academic and non-academic organizations. However, as computational social science (CSS) is still relatively new to the social sciences, CSS can feel like a hidden curriculum for many Ph.D. students. 

To support social science Ph.D. students, we provide an accessible tutorial for CSS training based on our collective working experiences in academic, public, and private sector organizations. We argue that students should supplement their traditional social science training in research design and domain expertise with CSS training, focused on three core areas: 

  * (1) learning data science skills; 
  * (2) building a portfolio that uses data science to answer social science questions; and 
  * (3) connecting with computational social scientists. 
  
We conclude with some practical recommendations for departments and professional associations to better support Ph.D. students.

## Orgnization 

Each session is organized by a 15-minute presentation, a moderated panel discussion, and an open Q&A.

We intentionally designed the tutorial this way so that the participants could benefit from the short presentations that can guide the following panel and open discussions. Participants can raise their questions and gain information and insights from presenters and other panelists regarding building skills and career paths in computational social science.
